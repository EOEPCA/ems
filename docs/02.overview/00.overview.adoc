* High-Level Description of the Building Block
* Context within EOEPCA
================================

The ADES provides a WPS 1.0 & 2.0 service interfaces as well as an OGC API Processes compliant API. It is responsible for the execution of the processing service (as a WPS request) within the ‘target’ Exploitation Platform (i.e. one that is close to the data). In the global scenario, we assume that the EMS ensures that the processor is deployed as a WPS service before it is invoked.

As illustrated in the EOEPCA Master System Design Document (ref. <<EOEPCA-MSD>>), the ADES provides an execution engine that handles the complexities of constructing the jobs and interfacing with the processing cluster. See the context wthin the EOEOPA, as depicted below in <<img_procAdesExecute>>:

The main responsibilities of the ADES are:
 
* Validate and accept an execution request from the EMS
* Submit the process execution to the processing cluster
* Monitor the process execution
* Retrieve the processing results

In order to accomplish the execution and monitor steps above, it also need to be responsible for the operations of:

* Data Stage-In for the process inputs
* Data Stage-Out for the process outputs

Those operations are internal sub-steps of the execution step.

=== Execution

The ADES performs an Execute operation upon a WPS ExecuteRequest, when instantiated by the EMS.

When performing the Execute operation, the ADES inspects the ExecuteRequest document, and instructs the underlying Kubernetes software, via a specific tool interpreting CWL workflows https://github.com/Duke-GCB/calrissian[Calrissian], to run the following steps:

* Data Stage-In
* Processing
* Data Stage-Out

Calrissian is responsible for the internal orchestration of the three steps above.
Additionally, when instructing Kubernetes to launch the jobs (stage-in/out or processing), the ADES provides also the reference of the Docker image to use, which is automatically retrieved from the processing nodes if not already present. 

==== Data Stage-In

Data Stage-In is the process to locally retrieve the inputs for the processing. Processing inputs are provided as EO Catalogue references and the ADES is responsible to translate those references into inputs available for the local processing.

ADES leverages an OpenSearch client when interacting with the EO Catalogue and standard libraries and tools for the local product retrieval (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/[libcurl], https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd[s3cmd]) to support the HTTP(S), FTP(S), FILE, OPeNDAP, and S3 protocols.

==== Processing

Processing is the core step of the Execute operation. During this step input data is transformed into outputs data.

ADES supports it by instructing the Kubernetes software, via Calrissian, to download and use the configured Docker image, to provide the processing parameters and inputs, to execute the configured processing command(s).

==== Data Stage-Out

Data Stage-Out is the process to upload remotely the outputs of the processing onto external system(s), and make them available for later usage.

ADES retrieves the processing outputs and automatically stores them onto an external persistent storage. Additionally, ADES publishes the metadata of the outputs onto a Catalogue, exposing the OpenSearch interface, and provides their references as an output. 
Monitor

=== Monitor

ADES monitors a submitted execution at regular intervals and reports back the progress status via a GetStatus operation.

=== Dismiss

ADES can remove from the execution environment an alredy started processing job.

== Static Architecture

This section contains:

* Diagram and description of the major logical components within the Building Block

================================

The ADES is based on an Web API framework architecture. It offers primarly an OWS Server with WPS 1.0 & 2.0 OGC services and it exposes a REST/JSON interface compliant with the OGC Processes API <<OGC-API-PROC>> compliant with the OpenAPI specification <<OPENAPI>>.

<<img_procAdesOverview>> shows an overview of the ADES building block. It provides the framework for the WPS Server to manage and execute the processing services that interact with the external Kubernetes cluster via the Calrissian tool.

The WPS Service provides the external interface of the ADES, available to the EMS only. It enables internal code and configuration for creating the Processing Services via the Deploy/Undeploy WPS operations.
Then, the WPS service triggers various function oif the Processing Services for the Execute, GetStatus, GetResult and Dismiss WPS operations.
Internally, every Processing Service deployed on the ADES, uses the common library to perform properly it's execution as per the Calrissian to submit, monitor, retrieve the results and dismiss a processing execution. 

Section <<Components Design>> contains a detailed description of the ADES components.

=== Deploy Processing Service

_As an EMS service, I want to deploy (and un-deploy) a processing service, using a reference posting a <<OWS Context>> from a Resource Catalog referencing a <<Common Workflow Language (CWL)>> so that I can make it available (or remove) for the Execution, on behalf of my User._

=== Execute Service as Job

_As an EMS service, I want to Execute an available processing service via the WPS & API interface, so that I can submit an execution, on behalf of my User._

=== Monitor Job

_As an EMS service, I want to get the status of a given processing job, via the WPS & API interface, so that I can monitor a current or past execution, and provide the information back to my User._

=== Retrieve Result

_As an EMS service, I want to get the reference of the processing results of a given processing job, via the WPS & API interface, so that I can provide the information back to my User._

== Required Resources

* List of HW and SW required resources for the correct functioning of the building Block
* References to open repositories (when applicable)

================================

=== Data

==== OWS Context

==== Common Workflow Language (CWL)

Common Workflow Language (CWL) is used as the application package descriptor. It covers the following elements necessary to describe the application:
* cyclic graph orchestrating the steps in order mapping workflow input/output with steps input/output
* Steps describing a command line with their input/output
* CWL specification extensions that may be used to provide the additional information elements 

The application package is thus composed of a CWL file with the role of the application descriptor.
The container reference is included in the CWL as a requirement.
